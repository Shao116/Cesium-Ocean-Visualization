**Project Name:** Pacific Ocean Current Visualization

**Description:**

A web-based 3D visualization tool for exploring the dynamic characteristics of major ocean currents in the Pacific. By integrating the latest oceanographic data and advanced visualization techniques, users can intuitively observe key metrics such as current speed, temperature, and direction. This project aims to provide an interactive platform for ocean scientists, educators, and ocean enthusiasts to explore and understand the impact of ocean currents on climate and ecosystems.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data visualization of current speed and temperature.
- Interactive globe with zoom, rotate, and pan capabilities for exploring current paths.
- Multilingual support in both Chinese and English for users of different language backgrounds.
- Educational resources with detailed ocean current encyclopedic data, suitable for teaching and popular science.

**Target Audience:**
- Oceanographers
- Environmental researchers
- Educators
- Students
- Ocean science enthusiasts

**Technology Stack:**
- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
- Cesium.js (for 3D globe and geospatial data visualization)
- Axios (for data loading)
- Three.js (for 3D effects)
